# Get quickly started
For quickly get BuilderJS up and running, you can put the whole builderjs/ folder into your web root
Then access it via its corresponding web URL. For example:

`http://localhost/builderjs/`

# Documentation
BuilderJS comes with pre-compiled source files (JavaScript and other assets) included in a `dist/` folder
Check out the `manual/` directory for our documentation in details
Double click the `manual/index.html` file to open it in your browser

# Sample scripts
You can use any server scripting language for handling BuilderJS requests (SAVE, EXPORT, etc.)
We have sample scripts in PHP for your reference.

# Source
BuilderJS comes with the original develoment bundle (in Node & Webpack) containing unminified source files
You can find it in the src/ folder if you are familiar with Node & Webpack
Check out the webpack.config.js file for more configuration details.

Basically you can start working with the development bundle using the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm run build`
`npx webpack --watch`

Thank you
